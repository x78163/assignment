This is a final 'systems check' for Ubiqum Code Academy prior to releasing us to work on our final projects.  The csv file assessment_joe.csv contains five columns of numbers.  The task is to predict column 5 values using columns 1-4.  I imported the data into separate columns in a dataframe and then removed all rows with NA's.  I approached this problem as both a classification (factor) and regresssion (number) task.  While the numbers were numbers, they had a small enough distribution to potentially be treated as factors.  For classification, I used Naive Bayes and C.50, but obtained very poor accuracy results.  Running regression based algorithms (RF, KNN, GBM and SVM resulted in KNN winning with a .99 R^2 and .5 RMSE.  I rounded the values to the nearest integer as the original data was integer based.  The resulting CSV file: Col5Predictions.csv is the original data slug with my predictions for column 5 using an optimized and trained KNN model.
